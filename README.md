What's the weather like as we approach the equator?

The purpose of this project is to analyze how weather changes as the location is closer to the equator, taking into account factors such as temperature, cloudiness, humidity and wind speed. For this analysis, I pulled the data from the OpenWeatherMap API to create a dataset with over 500 cities around the world and creater scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Temperature vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
